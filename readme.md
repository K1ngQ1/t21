Using the app:
	When loading into the app you will see a search bar with a drop down below it. To search for items enter search term in the field and hit enter or the search button. If you want to narrow down your search results you can enter into the field and select a dropdown item to narrow the search catagory. 
	If you want to add items to favourites press the item's heart button to the right to add to favourites. To see your favourites click on the big "Your Favourites" button on the bottom of the screen to see a list of your favourites. To delete an item from the list click the blue trash bin button and click your favourites again and it will be gone.
	
How to launch the app:
	To install the app open the backend folder in your terminal and input npm install and then npm start to launch then the same steps but with the frontend folder.
	If you want to test the app open the back or frontend you want to test in your terminal and input npm install if you have not already then npm test and it will run the test.
	If you want to launch the app open the back and front end folders in your terminal and enter in npm install if you have not already then simply npm start in the terminal and the app should open.
	
Security:
	My backend is secured with helmet and I am not worried about the api keys leaking inside the backend files because the search api is opensource and does not need an api key to work.
